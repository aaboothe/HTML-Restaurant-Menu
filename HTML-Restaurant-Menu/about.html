        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>
            Our families first restaurant was opened in our home town, Henderson Nevada. It was a huge success and we started having to turn customers down at the door.  It was at this time that we chose to expand to Summerlin Nevada but even with two locations we were still busy. Everyone loved Mom's recipies, we were also very lucky to find the best staff! We have grown and after ten years in the restaurant industry we have four thriving restaurants located in the Las Vegas area.
